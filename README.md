# Leetcode
Study algorithms in Leetcode, collect templates, and record the attendance of weekly and biweekly competitions.

```

```

All program files will be written in `.ipynb` files.

## For basic_algotithm

This part is for collection of basic algorithms. Each type of method will be written in files separately. 

In the file, first will give the template of this kind of method. Then list the problems that use this method to solve. All problem will be recorded as follow after solving the problem on the Leetcode website. Recorded items will contain the problem description, the methods and tricks for solving, the code implemented.

## For weekly

After the attendance of weekly competition, record how many problems solved when in competition, how did the problems solved, what the difficulties met, and the more optimal solution. Also, record the change of competition points after the competition.

## For biweekly

After the attendance of biweekly competition, record how many problems solved when in competition, how did the problems solved, what the difficulties met, and the more optimal solution. Also, record the change of competition points after the competition.
